## Key Features  

### **1. Multi-Agency Car Listings**  
- The platform hosts cars from **multiple rental agencies**, giving users a variety of options.  
- Each car listing includes detailed information such as car model, price, availability, and agency details.  

### **2. Seamless Reservation Process**  
- Users can **select and reserve a car** for their desired dates directly through the platform.  
- The system automatically disables unavailable dates, preventing double bookings.  

### **3. Google Calendar Integration**  
- Upon reservation, the system syncs with the agency's **Google Calendar** using the Google Calendar API.  
- The reserved dates are blocked in the calendar, allowing agencies to easily manage their car schedules and availability.

## How It Works  

1. **Browse Cars**: Users can view a wide selection of cars listed by different agencies.  
2. **Select Dates**: They choose available dates on a calendar, which highlights unavailable dates in gray.
